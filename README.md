gorrent-server
==============
`gorrent-server` is an application, one half of the full Gorrent experience.

This piece of software functions as a server for most of the operations undertaken by the user,
in order to abstract away some of the general functions of the torrent client into
an interface-agnostic form.

It's still a major work in progress, so please don't be surprised if
nothing works - it's meant to fail in a lot of ways. Not to mention that,
as of writing this README, there's no actual functionality.
